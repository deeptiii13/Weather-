Weather apps have become a ubiquitous tool for many people in their daily lives. It is a handy tool that provides users with current weather conditions in their location or any other selected location in the world. The app uses data from weather data provider to fetch real-time weather updates.

To provide weather information based on the user's location, the weather app uses a geolocation API to determine the device's coordinates. The geolocation API allows the app to access the device's GPS and provide the app with the user's location coordinates. Once the app has access to the user's location coordinates, it can fetch weather data for that particular location.

The app then sends an API request to a weather data provider, which provides information such as current temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and forecasted weather conditions.

The app then processes the weather data received from the API and displays it in an easy-to-understand format for the user. The user-friendly interface of these apps makes it a convenient tool for users to plan their activities and stay informed about the weather.

Furthermore, modern weather apps also allow users to view weather data for locations other than their current location. The app fetches weather data for the selected location using its coordinates and displays it to the user. This feature is useful for people who travel frequently or want to keep track of weather conditions in their loved ones' locations.

It can be incredibly useful for farmers, as they provide important information about weather conditions and forecasts that can help with decision-making related to farming practices. It can provide information about precipitation levels, temperature, wind speed, and humidity in real-time. This information is crucial for farmers to make informed decisions about irrigation, crop protection, and harvesting.
